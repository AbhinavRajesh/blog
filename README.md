## Write/Edit blogs

- Take a local copy of your blog
  `git clone https://github.com/AbhinavRajesh/blog.git`
- `cd blog` to the new cloned folder
- `npm run dev` to run a dev server

The new repository will have a `content` folder in the root directory. You can edit blogs from there and you can create a new folder with `index.md` to create a new blog.

To see the final output, you can build the site with `npm run build`
